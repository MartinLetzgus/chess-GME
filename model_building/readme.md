## Feature engineering

The original dataset cannot be computed by machine learning algorithms, so I had to select or create meaningful variables.

## Model Building

Split of the dataset into a training and a test set
Training of several models
Optimization of the hpp of the models
Comparison of the models
Save the model as a pickle file (mlp_model.p)
